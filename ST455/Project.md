## Project topics
 
Your project should demonstrate an understanding of concepts, methods and models in the area of Reinforcement Learning and how to use/apply them using software frameworks in Python. This should involve using knowledge acquired in the course and building on this knowledge through an independent study to go more deeply into a specific subject. Your project may cover different aspects of _reinforcement learning_ methods, demonstrating an understanding of their suitability for a given class of problems, how to implement and validate them using synthetic and/or real datasets. The project can also comprise case studies involving specialised and/or complex scenarios in which you can experiment with different actions, states, rewards and policies. You may consider establishing some theoretical properties regarding RL methods or proposing your own methods. Development of the new theories and methodologies are **not** necessary, but you will get a high mark if these developments contain enough novelty.
 
Your **report would typically be in the form of a Jupyter notebook**, containing code, **along with a Markdown text** explaining different parts. You may want to provide a tutorial-like exposition for certain subjects covered in your project. For example, this may include instructions for loading specific libraries and/or packages you have used, preprocessing tasks you have applied to your datasets and specific requirements for running your models. **Your report and any other project related material should be submitted in the GitHub classroom repo** that will be assigned to your project.
 
It is expected from **your report to be** presented up to a high professional standard. This means that it has to be **structured well**, neat and polished. 
Your report should have a title, abstract, main content body, conclusion, and a list of references. 
In the abstract, please make sure to briefly describe what is the problem addressed by your project, why is the problem a problem, 
what is your solution and why you have chosen given solution. The abstract should be short, a paragraph of 5-10 sentences. 

You may use **visualizations** in your report, for example using Matplotlib, Tensorboard and other Python libraries. 

Your **report may describe a working prototype application**. In this case, your report should contain a clear and full description of the steps that one needs to follow in order to run your application. 

Your **report should cite any references that you use**. You may also discuss and cite any previously proposed alternative solutions to your problem. The conclusion section should briefly summarise the results of your project, highlight your main findings, and briefly discuss any interesting avenues for future research.

You might want to discuss your project topic with Chengchun. The list of candidate projects is given below to give you some idea about potential project topics. **You may (but you are not expected) to take one of the project topics listed below**.
